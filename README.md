## Description

Module 01 Challenge - Make a site more accessible. This assignment required that I refactor the existing code in order to follow accessibility guidelines. I replaced div elements with semantic HTML. Also, I refactored the CSS to be more concise and consolidated. The CSS also follows the HTML hierarchical structure and is commented so that it is possible to better discern the HTML that is affected.

## Installation

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
